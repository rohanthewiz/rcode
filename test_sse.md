# SSE Connection Test Instructions

## Testing the SSE Fix

1. **Start the server**: `go run main.go`

2. **Open the application**: Navigate to http://localhost:8000

3. **Login with Claude Pro/Max** if not already authenticated

4. **Open browser developer console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)

5. **Observe normal connection**:
   - Console should show "SSE connection established"
   - No connection status indicator should be visible in the header

6. **Stop the backend** (Ctrl+C in the terminal)

7. **Observe the new behavior**:
   - Connection status indicator appears showing "Disconnected"
   - Console shows reconnection attempts with exponential backoff
   - After 10 attempts, it stops and shows "Connection lost. Reconnect"
   - No continuous errors accumulating

8. **Manual reconnection (with backend still down)**:
   - Click the "Reconnect" link in the connection status
   - Status should immediately change to "Reconnecting... (1/10)"
   - Console should show reconnection attempts with exponential backoff
   - After 10 more attempts, it should stop again

9. **Manual reconnection (after restarting backend)**:
   - Start the backend again: `go run main.go`
   - Click the "Reconnect" link
   - Connection should be re-established
   - Status indicator should disappear (connected state)

## Expected Behavior

- **Exponential backoff**: Delays double each time (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s...)
- **Max 10 attempts**: After 10 failed attempts, auto-reconnect stops
- **Visual feedback**: Connection status shows current state
- **Manual control**: User can manually trigger reconnection
- **No page crash**: The page remains functional even when backend is down

## What Was Fixed

1. Added connection tracking variables
2. Implemented exponential backoff algorithm
3. Limited reconnection attempts to 10
4. Added connection status indicator in UI
5. Provided manual reconnection option
6. Properly close failed connections to prevent resource leaks
