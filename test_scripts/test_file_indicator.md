# File Modification Indicator Test

## Testing Steps

1. Start the RCode server
2. Login with Claude Pro/Max
3. Send a message asking Claude to create or modify a file
4. Watch the file explorer for the modification indicator (●)

## Expected Behavior

When a file is modified by Claude (through tools like write_file or edit_file):
- A `diff_available` event should be broadcast
- The file should be marked with a dot indicator (●) in the file explorer
- The dot should be visible next to the filename

When a file is changed (through file_changed events):
- Files marked as "modified" or "created" should show the indicator
- Files marked as "deleted" should have the indicator removed

## Visual Indicator

### New Files
- A green dot (●) next to the filename
- The tree node will have the "new" CSS class
- A green left border on the tree node
- On hover, the tooltip will say "New file"

### Modified Files
- An orange dot (●) next to the filename
- The tree node will have the "modified" CSS class
- An orange left border on the tree node
- On hover, the tooltip will say "File has been modified"

## Context Menu

Right-clicking on a modified file should show:
- "View Changes" option (when diff is available)
- Standard options (Open, Rename, Delete, Copy Path)
