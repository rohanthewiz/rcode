# Image Support Implementation - Progress Summary

## What We've Accomplished

We've successfully implemented the foundation for comprehensive image support in RCode, enabling users to:
- Paste images from clipboard
- Send images to Claude AI for analysis
- Process images through the backend API

## Key Implementations

### 1. Backend Enhancements
- **read_file tool** (`tools/read_file.go`):
  - Detects image files by extension (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, etc.)
  - Encodes images as base64 for transmission
  - Returns structured FileResult with metadata

- **clipboard_paste tool** (`tools/clipboard.go`):
  - New tool to handle clipboard content
  - Validates and processes base64 image data
  - Detects image types from binary signatures
  - Can save images to temporary files

### 2. API Updates
- **Anthropic Provider** (`providers/anthropic.go`):
  - Added ImageContent and ImageSource structures
  - Created helper functions for mixed content messages
  - Updated ConvertToAPIMessages to handle images in metadata
  - Supports Anthropic's Vision API format

### 3. Frontend Clipboard Support
- **UI JavaScript** (`web/assets/js/ui.js`):
  - Added setupClipboardHandling() function
  - Paste event listeners on Monaco editor
  - Converts clipboard images to base64
  - Shows visual notifications when images are pasted
  - Includes images in message requests

### 4. Backend Message Handling
- **Session Handler** (`web/session.go`):
  - Updated MessageRequest to accept images
  - Modified message processing to handle image data
  - Stores images in message metadata
  - Passes images through to Anthropic API

## Current Capabilities
✅ Paste images from clipboard (Cmd/Ctrl+V)
✅ Convert images to base64 format
✅ Send images with text messages to Claude
✅ Process multiple image formats
✅ Visual feedback when images are pasted

## Still To Implement
- Drag & drop image files
- Display images inline in messages
- Auto-detect file paths and load images
- Image preview before sending
- Image viewer modal for full-size viewing
- Support for multiple images per message

## Testing Instructions

To test the current implementation:

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   ./rcode
   ```

2. **Test clipboard paste:**
   - Copy an image to clipboard (from browser, screenshot tool, etc.)
   - Click in the message input area
   - Press Cmd+V (Mac) or Ctrl+V (Windows/Linux)
   - You should see:
     - A notification saying "Image pasted"
     - Text in the input showing "[Image pasted: image/png - XXkB]"
   - Type a message like "What's in this image?"
   - Send the message

3. **Test file reading (future):**
   - Type a message with an image path: "Look at ~/Desktop/screenshot.png"
   - The system should detect the path and load the image

## Known Limitations
- Currently supports single image per message
- Images are limited to ~5MB (base64 encoding adds 33% overhead)
- No visual preview of pasted images yet
- Images not displayed in chat history yet

## Code Quality
✅ Compiles without errors
✅ Follows project conventions
✅ Uses existing error handling patterns
✅ Integrated with existing tool system
✅ Maintains backward compatibility

## Next Development Phase
1. Add drag & drop support for image files
2. Implement image rendering in messages
3. Add file path auto-detection
4. Create image preview component
5. Add tests for image handling
6. Optimize for large images (compression, thumbnails)
