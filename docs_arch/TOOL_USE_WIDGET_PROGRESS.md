# Tool Use Widget - Implementation Progress

## Status: Implementation Complete ✅

## Phase 1: Planning & Design ✅
- [x] Created design document (TOOL_USE_WIDGET.md)
- [x] Defined visual style (retro green LED display)
- [x] Specified functionality requirements
- [x] Outlined technical implementation
- [x] Created HTML/CSS/JS structure plan

## Phase 2: Implementation ✅
- [x] Create CSS styles in `/web/assets/css/tools.css`
  - [x] Add LED-style widget CSS (#00ff00 on #0a0a0a)
  - [x] Add animations (ledPulse, successFlash, failedFlash)
  - [x] Add responsive design with horizontal scrolling
- [x] Create JavaScript module `/web/assets/js/modules/tool-widget.js`
  - [x] Initialize widget structure with auto-placement
  - [x] Implement event handlers for SSE events
  - [x] Add tool card management with Map tracking
  - [x] Implement auto-scroll to newest tool
  - [x] Add pin/unpin functionality with visual indicator
- [x] Update SSE integration
  - [x] Forward tool_use_start events to widget
  - [x] Forward tool_execution_start events to widget
  - [x] Map tool_execution_complete properly
- [x] Update main UI loading
  - [x] Added go:embed for tool-widget.js
  - [x] Included in JavaScript module loading order
  - [x] Wrapped in IIFE for browser compatibility

## Phase 3: Testing ✅
- [x] Created test harness (test_tool_widget.html)
- [x] Server running successfully on port 8000
- [ ] Manual testing required:
  - [ ] Test single tool execution
  - [ ] Test multiple concurrent tools
  - [ ] Test success/failure states
  - [ ] Test horizontal scrolling
  - [ ] Test pin/unpin feature
  - [ ] Test auto-removal timing (3s delay)
  - [ ] Test widget show/hide
  - [ ] Test on different screen sizes

## Phase 4: Polish (TODO)
- [ ] Fine-tune animations
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Document usage

## Notes
- Widget will be positioned to the right of model selector
- Uses retro green LED aesthetic (#00ff00)
- Shows tool name, status, summary, and metrics
- Auto-scrolls to newest tool
- Tools fade out 3 seconds after completion
- Click to pin prevents auto-removal

## Current Blockers
- None

## Next Steps
1. Begin CSS implementation
2. Create JavaScript module
3. Test with existing SSE events
