## Summary of Completed Features

### Backend (Go)

- ✅ File operations handler with all CRUD operations (`web/file_operations.go`)
- ✅ API endpoints registered in routes
- ✅ Path validation and security checks
- ✅ Protected file safeguards

### Frontend (JavaScript/CSS)
- ✅ Context menu with all file operations
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V, Del, F2)
- ✅ Multi-select support (Ctrl/Cmd click, Shift click, Ctrl+A)
- ✅ Visual feedback for cut files (opacity/strikethrough)
- ✅ Notification system for user feedback
- ✅ Clipboard state management
- ✅ Integration with existing file tree

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/files` - List directory contents
- `POST /api/files/copy` - Copy files to clipboard
- `POST /api/files/cut` - Cut files to clipboard

- [ ] Download zip files directly from UI

## Implementation Details

### Completed: Clipboard Manager
✅ Created `web/clipboard.go` with:
- ClipboardManager for session isolation
- Support for copy and cut modes
- Thread-safe operations
- Automatic cleanup of old clipboards

### Current Focus: API Endpoints
Creating REST API endpoints for:
- List directory contents
- Copy files to clipboard
- Cut files to clipboard
- Paste from clipboard
- Delete files
- Get/clear clipboard status

### Next Steps:
1. Create file_operations.go handler
2. Add routes to web/routes.go
3. Implement UI components

## Notes
- Following safety-first approach with path validation
- Ensuring atomic operations where possible
- Adding comprehensive error handling

## Blockers
None currently

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests for clipboard manager
- [ ] Unit tests for each tool
- [ ] Integration tests for full workflows
- [ ] Edge case testing
- [ ] Performance testing with large files
