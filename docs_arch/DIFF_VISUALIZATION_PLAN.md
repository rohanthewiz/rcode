# RCode Diff Visualization Implementation Plan

## Date: 2025-07-19
## Phase 4, Step 2: Diff Visualization - Before/After Comparison

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing a diff visualization feature in RCode, enabling users to see clear before/after comparisons when files are modified by AI tools.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
1. **Tools that Modify Files**:
   - `write_file` - Creates or overwrites files
   - `edit_file` - Line-based editing with basic diff output
   - `git_diff` - Shows git differences
   - Various directory operations that affect files

2. **UI Components**:
   - Monaco Editor integration for code display
   - File Explorer with read-only viewing
   - SSE for real-time updates
   - Dark theme with syntax highlighting

3. **Relevant Features**:
   - File change notifications via SSE
   - Session-based file tracking
   - Tool usage summaries with metrics

## Design Specification

```

#### Display Modes
1. **Side-by-Side** (default): Shows before and after in parallel columns
2. **Inline**: Shows changes inline with +/- indicators
3. **Unified**: Traditional unified diff format

#### Visual Indicators
- **Added Lines**: Green background (#2ea043)
- **Removed Lines**: Red background (#f85149)
- **Modified Lines**: Yellow background (#e3b341)
- **Line Numbers**: Dimmed, non-selectable
- **Unchanged Context**: Default background with reduced opacity

### 2. Backend Architecture

#### Diff Generation Service
```go
package web

type DiffService struct {
    // Stores file snapshots for diff generation
    snapshots map[string]FileSnapshot
    mu        sync.RWMutex
}

type FileSnapshot struct {
    Path      string
    Content   string
    Timestamp time.Time
    Hash      string
}

type DiffResult struct {
    Path     string       `json:"path"`
    Before   string       `json:"before"`
    After    string       `json:"after"`
    Hunks    []DiffHunk   `json:"hunks"`
    Stats    DiffStats    `json:"stats"`
}

type DiffHunk struct {
    OldStart int          `json:"oldStart"`
    OldLines int          `json:"oldLines"`
    NewStart int          `json:"newStart"`
    NewLines int          `json:"newLines"`
    Lines    []DiffLine   `json:"lines"`
}

type DiffLine struct {
    Type     string       `json:"type"` // "add", "delete", "context"
    OldLine  *int         `json:"oldLine,omitempty"`
    NewLine  *int         `json:"newLine,omitempty"`
    Content  string       `json:"content"`
}

type DiffStats struct {
    Added    int          `json:"added"`
    Deleted  int          `json:"deleted"`
    Modified int          `json:"modified"`
}
```

#### API Endpoints
```go
// New endpoints for diff functionality
GET  /api/diff/:sessionId/:path     // Get diff for a file
POST /api/diff/snapshot              // Create snapshot before modification
GET  /api/session/:id/diffs          // List all diffs in session
POST /api/diff/apply                 // Apply a diff (undo/redo)
```

### 3. Tool Integration

#### Enhanced Tool Execution Flow
1. **Before Execution**: Capture file snapshot
2. **Execute Tool**: Perform the modification
3. **After Execution**: Generate and store diff
4. **Broadcast Event**: Notify UI with diff ID

#### Modified Tool Result
```go
type ToolResult struct {
    Success  bool
    Output   interface{}
    Error    string
    Metadata map[string]interface{}
    Diff     *DiffResult  // New field for diff information
}
```

### 4. Frontend Components

#### React-less Diff Viewer
```javascript
class DiffViewer {
    constructor(container, options = {}) {
        this.container = container;
        this.mode = options.mode || 'side-by-side';
        this.wordWrap = options.wordWrap || false;
        this.theme = options.theme || 'dark';
        this.beforeEditor = null;
        this.afterEditor = null;
        this.unifiedEditor = null;
    }

    render(diffResult) {
        switch(this.mode) {
            case 'side-by-side':
                this.renderSideBySide(diffResult);
                break;
            case 'inline':
                this.renderInline(diffResult);
                break;
            case 'unified':
                this.renderUnified(diffResult);
                break;
        }
    }

    renderSideBySide(diffResult) {
        // Create two Monaco editors side by side
        // Apply decorations for added/removed lines
        // Synchronize scrolling
    }

    highlightChanges(editor, lines, type) {
        // Apply Monaco decorations for diff highlighting
    }

    syncScroll(editor1, editor2) {
        // Synchronize scrolling between editors
    }
}
```

#### Integration with File Explorer
- Add "View Changes" option to modified files
- Show diff indicator (●) next to modified files
- Quick diff preview on hover

### 5. UI/UX Features

#### Diff Viewer Modal
```html
<div id="diff-modal" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content diff-viewer-content">
        <div class="diff-header">
            <h3>📄 <span id="diff-filename">filename</span> - Changes</h3>
            <button class="btn-close">×</button>
        </div>

```

### 6. Diff Algorithms

#### Line-based Diff
- Use Myers' diff algorithm for line-by-line comparison
- Implement in Go for server-side generation
- Support for context lines (default: 3)

#### Word-level Diff
- Highlight word-level changes within modified lines
- Useful for small edits within lines
- Toggle via UI option

#### Syntax-aware Diff
- Consider language syntax for better diff display
- Group related changes (e.g., function modifications)
- Collapse unchanged regions

### 7. Integration Points

#### With File Explorer
- Show modification indicator on changed files
- Quick diff preview on hover
- "Compare with Original" context menu option

#### With Chat Interface
- Inline diff summaries in tool responses
- "View Full Diff" links for detailed view
- Diff statistics in tool usage summaries

#### With SSE Events
- Real-time diff generation on file changes
- Broadcast diff availability to all clients
- Update diff viewer if open

### 8. Data Persistence

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Store file snapshots for diff generation
CREATE TABLE file_snapshots (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    tool_execution_id TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES sessions(id)
);

-- Store generated diffs
CREATE TABLE diffs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    before_snapshot_id INTEGER,
    after_snapshot_id INTEGER,
    diff_data JSON NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES sessions(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (before_snapshot_id) REFERENCES file_snapshots(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (after_snapshot_id) REFERENCES file_snapshots(id)
);
```

### 9. Performance Considerations

#### Optimization Strategies
1. **Lazy Loading**: Generate diffs on demand, not automatically
2. **Caching**: Cache generated diffs for repeated viewing
3. **Streaming**: Stream large diffs instead of loading all at once
4. **Virtual Scrolling**: For very large files
5. **Web Workers**: Offload diff computation for large files

#### Limits
- Maximum file size for diff: 1MB
- Maximum diff hunks: 1000
- Context lines: Configurable (0-10)

### 10. User Workflows

#### Viewing Changes
1. AI modifies a file via tool
2. User sees notification: "main.go was modified"
3. User clicks notification or file in explorer
4. Diff viewer opens showing changes
5. User can switch between view modes
6. User can apply or revert changes

#### Comparing Versions
1. User selects file in explorer
2. Right-click → "Compare with..."
3. Options: Original, Previous Change, Git HEAD
4. Diff viewer opens with selected comparison

#### Batch Changes
1. AI makes multiple file modifications
2. User sees summary: "5 files modified"
3. User clicks to see all diffs
4. Navigate between diffs with Previous/Next

## Implementation Context (Added 2025-07-19)

### Recent Implementations to Build Upon

#### 1. File Explorer (Phase 4, Step 1 - Completed)
The File Explorer has been fully implemented with:
- **Backend Service**: `web/file_explorer.go` with FileExplorerService
- **UI Components**: `web/file_tree_component.go` using element package
- **Frontend Module**: `web/assets/js/fileExplorer.js` 
- **Tab Interface**: Sidebar with Sessions/Files tabs
- **File Tracking**: Database integration for session file access
- **SSE Integration**: Real-time file change notifications
- **Monaco Editor**: Read-only file viewing already in place

Key interfaces that can be reused:
```go
// FileChangeNotifier interface in tools/file_events.go
type FileChangeNotifier interface {
    NotifyFileChanged(path string, changeType string)
    NotifyFileTreeUpdate(path string)
}
```

#### 2. Task Planning System (Phase 3 - Completed)
The planning system provides:
- **Snapshot Management**: `planner/snapshots.go` already handles file snapshots
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Can be extended for diff-based undo/redo
- **Database Schema**: Existing snapshot tables can be adapted

#### 3. Error Recovery System (Phase 1 - Completed)
Provides robust retry mechanisms that should be used for:
- Diff generation failures
- Snapshot capture errors
- API endpoint failures

### Key Files to Reference

1. **For UI Integration**:
   - `web/ui.go` - Main UI generation with element
   - `web/assets/js/ui.js` - Core JavaScript functionality
   - `web/assets/css/ui.css` - Styling variables and themes

2. **For Tool Integration**:
   - `tools/tool.go` - Tool interface and result structure
   - `tools/enhanced_registry.go` - Tool execution flow
   - `tools/edit_file.go` - Already has basic diff output

3. **For SSE Events**:

4. **For Database**:
   - `db/migrations.go` - Add migration #6 for diff tables
   - `db/file_tracking.go` - Reference for file-related queries

### Monaco Editor Setup
Monaco is already loaded and configured in the UI:
- Available as `window.monaco`
- Dark theme configured
- Language detection implemented
- Can create multiple editor instances

### Existing CSS Variables
The app uses these CSS variables that should be reused:
- `--bg-primary`: #0a0a0a
- `--bg-secondary`: #1a1a1a
- `--text-primary`: #e0e0e0
- `--border`: #333
- `--accent`: #0084ff
- `--error`: #ff5555
- `--success`: #50fa7b

### SSE Event Types
Current SSE event types that can be extended:
- `message` - Chat messages
- `tool_use` - Tool execution
- `tool_result` - Tool completion
- `error` - Error messages
- `file_changed` - File modifications
- `file_tree_update` - Directory changes

Add new types:
- `diff_available` - When diff is generated
- `diff_update` - When diff changes

### Git Integration
The git tools already provide diff functionality:
- `git_diff` tool shows git diffs
- Can be used as reference for diff formatting
- Git rollback system tracks operations

### Testing Approach
1. Start with manual testing using test files
2. Create test endpoints for snapshot/diff generation
3. Use existing test_scripts directory for test files
4. Integration tests with file modification tools

## Implementation Progress (Updated 2025-07-20)

### Completed Components

#### Backend (Fully Operational)
1. **Diff Service (`diff/diff_service.go`)**
   - In-memory snapshot management with thread-safe operations
   - Snapshot creation, retrieval, and cleanup
   - Integration with diff algorithm

2. **Diff Algorithm (`diff/diff_algorithm.go`)**
   - Line-based diff using Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
   - Generates hunks with context lines
   - Produces statistics (added, deleted, modified lines)
   - Output format compatible with frontend rendering

3. **Database Layer**
   - Migration #6 added with all required tables:
     - `diff_snapshots` - Stores file content snapshots
     - `diffs` - Stores generated diffs with JSON data
     - `diff_views` - Tracks which diffs have been viewed
     - `diff_preferences` - User preferences for diff viewing
   - Storage operations in `db/diff_storage.go`

4. **API Endpoints (`web/diff_handlers.go`)**
   - All planned endpoints implemented and tested
   - Proper error handling with rweb framework
   - JSON responses for all diff operations

5. **Tool Integration (`tools/diff_integration.go`)**
   - Hooks for before/after file modifications
   - Automatic snapshot capture for relevant tools
   - SSE broadcasting of diff availability
   - Session-aware diff tracking

6. **Circular Dependency Resolution**
   - Created `diff` package to separate concerns
   - Implemented EventBroadcaster interface
   - Adapter pattern in `web/diff_broadcaster.go`
   - Clean separation between packages

#### Frontend (Partially Complete)
1. **DiffViewer Class (`web/assets/js/diffViewer.js`)**
   - Complete modal-based UI implementation
   - Support for all three view modes
   - Preference management
   - SSE notification handling
   - Apply/revert functionality (placeholder)

### Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **Algorithm Choice**: LCS over Myers' algorithm for simplicity and adequate performance
2. **Storage Strategy**: In-memory snapshots with database persistence for durability
3. **UI Approach**: Modal-based viewer instead of inline to avoid complexity
4. **Diff Format**: Custom JSON format optimized for frontend rendering

### Remaining Tasks for Completion

#### High Priority
1. **CSS Styling**
   - Create `web/assets/css/diffViewer.css`
   - Implement all styling from the plan
   - Ensure consistency with existing dark theme

2. **UI Integration**
   - Include diffViewer.js in main UI (`web/ui.go`)
   - Add CSS file to UI includes
   - Wire up SSE event handling for `diff_available` events

3. **File Explorer Integration**
   - Add diff indicators to modified files
   - Context menu option for "View Changes"
   - Click handler to open diff viewer

#### Medium Priority
1. **Monaco Editor Integration**
   - Replace simple HTML rendering with Monaco editors
   - Implement synchronized scrolling
   - Add syntax highlighting to diffs

2. **Testing**
   - Create test files for various diff scenarios
   - Test with large files for performance
   - Verify tool integration works correctly

#### Low Priority
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Word-level diff highlighting
   - Keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys for navigation)
   - Export diff as patch file
   - Actual apply/revert implementation

### Context for Next Session

#### Current State
- Backend is fully functional and tested
- Frontend has basic implementation but needs:
  - CSS styling
  - Integration with main UI
  - Monaco Editor for better visualization
  - Connection to File Explorer

#### Next Steps
1. Create CSS file with all diff viewer styles
2. Add script and style includes to `web/ui.go`
3. Modify `web/assets/js/ui.js` to handle diff SSE events
4. Test end-to-end flow with file modifications

#### Testing Commands
```bash
# Build and run server
go build -o rcode .
./rcode

# Test diff generation (in browser console)
// After modifying a file through AI
window.diffViewer.show(1) // Show diff with ID 1
```

#### Known Issues
1. GetSnapshot may return nil - need nil checks in handlers
2. Apply/revert is placeholder - needs actual implementation
3. No actual Monaco integration yet - using HTML rendering

## Conclusion

The diff visualization feature will significantly enhance RCode's usability by providing clear, visual feedback on file modifications. By integrating deeply with the existing tool system and using Monaco Editor's capabilities, we can deliver a professional-grade diff viewing experience that rivals dedicated diff tools while maintaining the simplicity and elegance of the RCode interface.

With the File Explorer implementation complete and the backend diff system fully operational, we have a solid foundation for completing the frontend visualization. The remaining work is primarily UI/UX focused, with all the complex backend logic already in place.
