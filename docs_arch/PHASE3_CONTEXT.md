# Phase 3 Implementation Context

## Session Summary
This session focused on implementing Phase 3 of the rcode enhancement plan: Agent Enhancement (Task Planning, Multi-step Execution, and Rollback Capabilities).

## Completed Work

### 1. Database Migration
- Created migration #4 in `db/migrations.go` with tables:
  - `task_plans` - Stores task plans with steps and context
  - `task_executions` - Tracks individual step executions
  - `file_snapshots` - Content-addressed file backups for rollback
  - `task_metrics` - Performance metrics collection
  - `task_logs` - Detailed execution logs
- Fixed DuckDB compatibility (removed CASCADE constraints)

### 2. Snapshot Manager (`planner/snapshots.go`)
- Implemented content-addressed file storage for efficient deduplication
- Created snapshot creation and restoration functionality
- Integrated with checkpoint system for rollback support
- Features:
  - SHA256-based content addressing
  - File permission preservation
  - Backup creation before restoration
  - Snapshot verification

### 3. Database Persistence Layer (`db/tasks.go`)
- Created `TaskPlanDB` struct with comprehensive CRUD operations:
  - `SavePlan`, `GetPlan`, `GetSessionPlans`
  - `SaveExecution`, `GetExecutions`
  - `SaveSnapshot`, `GetSnapshots`, `GetSnapshotByHash`
  - `SaveMetrics`, `GetMetrics`
  - `SaveLog`, `GetLogs`
- Proper JSON marshaling for complex types

### 4. API Endpoints (`web/planning.go`)
- Implemented all task planning endpoints:
  - `POST /api/session/:id/plan` - Create a new task plan
  - `GET /api/session/:id/plans` - List plans for a session
  - `POST /api/plan/:id/execute` - Execute a plan
  - `GET /api/plan/:id/status` - Get plan status with metrics
  - `POST /api/plan/:id/rollback` - Rollback to checkpoint
  - `GET /api/plan/:id/checkpoints` - List checkpoints
- Added SSE broadcasting for real-time updates
- Routes added to `web/routes.go`

### 5. Planner Enhancements
- **Factory Pattern** (`planner/factory.go`):
  - Created `PlannerFactory` for proper dependency injection
  - `SnapshotStoreAdapter` to bridge db and planner packages
  - Avoided import cycles while maintaining functionality
  
- **Context-Aware Analyzer** (`planner/analyzer.go`):
  - Added `NewTaskAnalyzerWithContext` constructor
  - Enhanced `analyzeTaskWithContext` method
  - Keyword extraction from task descriptions
  - File detection in task descriptions
  - Search pattern generation
  
- **Planner Integration** (`planner/planner.go`):
  - Added snapshot creation in `createCheckpoint`
  - Implemented file restoration in `RollbackToCheckpoint`
  - Updated `NewPlanner` to use context-aware analyzer

### 6. Type System (`planner/types.go`)
- Added missing fields to `TaskPlanner`:
  - `SessionID`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`, `CompletedAt`
- Updated `PlannerOptions` with new fields:
  - `CheckpointInterval`, `ContextManager`

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Import Cycle Resolution
- Used interface{} for cross-package dependencies
- Created adapter patterns to avoid direct imports
- Factory pattern for proper initialization

### 2. Content-Addressed Storage
- SHA256 hashing for deduplication
- Two-level directory structure (first 2 chars of hash)
- Stores content both in filesystem and database

### 3. Checkpoint System
- Automatic checkpoint creation every N steps
- Stores file snapshots, variables, and completed steps
- Supports full and selective rollback

## Current State

### Working Features
- Task plan creation with context-aware analysis
- Plan persistence in database
- File snapshot creation and restoration
- API endpoints for plan management
- SSE events for real-time updates
- Basic rollback functionality

### Pending Implementation
1. **Parallel Execution** - Structure exists in plan, needs implementation
2. **Execution Metrics Collection** - Database ready, collection logic needed
3. **Git Operations Rollback** - Placeholder exists, needs implementation
4. **Tool Integration** - Need to connect planner with actual tool execution
5. **UI Components** - Frontend for plan visualization and control

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Implement parallel execution in `planner/parallel_executor.go`
2. Add metrics collection during step execution
3. Complete Git rollback implementation
4. Create UI components for plan management

### Testing Requirements
1. Unit tests for planner components
2. Integration tests for API endpoints
3. End-to-end tests for plan execution
4. Rollback scenario testing

### Documentation Needs
1. API documentation for new endpoints
2. User guide for task planning features
3. Architecture documentation for planner system

## Key Files Modified/Created
- `/db/migrations.go` - Added migration #4
- `/db/tasks.go` - New file for task persistence
- `/planner/snapshots.go` - New file for snapshot management
- `/planner/factory.go` - New file for dependency injection
- `/planner/analyzer.go` - Enhanced with context awareness
- `/planner/planner.go` - Integrated snapshot support
- `/planner/snapshot_store.go` - Adapter for database
- `/web/planning.go` - New file with API handlers
- `/web/routes.go` - Added planning routes
- `/phase3-implementation-plan.md` - Updated with progress

## Important Notes
1. The snapshot manager uses `~/.local/share/rcode/snapshots/` for file storage
2. DuckDB doesn't support CASCADE constraints - removed from migration
3. Import cycles were avoided using interface{} and adapter patterns
4. The planner is designed to be stateless with all state in the database
5. File snapshots are content-addressed for efficient storage
