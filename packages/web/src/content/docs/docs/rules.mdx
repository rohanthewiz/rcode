title: Rules
---

You can provide custom instructions to opencode by creating an `AGENTS.md` file. This is similar to `CLAUDE.md` or Cursor's rules. It contains instructions that will be included in the LLM's context to customize its behavior for your specific project.

---

## Initialize

To create a new `AGENTS.md` file, you can run the `/init` command in opencode.

:::tip
You should commit your project's `AGENTS.md` file to Git.
:::

This will scan your project and all its contents to understand what the project is about and generate an `AGENTS.md` file with it. This helps opencode to navigate the project better.

If you have an existing `AGENTS.md` file, this will try to add to it.

---

## Example

You can also just create this file manually. Here's an example of some things you can put into an `AGENTS.md` file.

# SST v3 Monorepo Project

This is an SST v3 monorepo with TypeScript. The project uses bun workspaces for package management.

## Project Structure
- `packages/` - Contains all workspace packages (functions, core, web, etc.)
- `infra/` - Infrastructure definitions split by service (storage.ts, api.ts, web.ts)
- `sst.config.ts` - Main SST configuration with dynamic imports

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Shared code goes in `packages/core/` with proper exports configuration
- Functions go in `packages/functions/`
- Infrastructure should be split into logical files in `infra/`

## Monorepo Conventions
- Import shared modules using workspace names: `@my-app/core/example`
```

We are adding project-specific instructions here and this will be shared across your team.

---

## Types

opencode also supports reading the `AGENTS.md` file from multiple locations. And this serves different purposes.

### Project

The ones we have seen above, where the `AGENTS.md` is placed in the project root, are project-specific rules. These only apply when you are working in this directory or its sub-directories.

### Global

You can also have global rules in a `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` file. This gets applied across all opencode sessions.

Since this isn't committed to Git or shared with your team, we recommend using this to specify any personal rules that the LLM should follow.

---

## Precedence

So when opencode starts, it looks for:

1. **Local files** by traversing up from the current directory
2. **Global file** by checking `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`

If you have both global and project-specific rules, opencode will combine them together.
